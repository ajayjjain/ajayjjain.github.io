Evan De Broux and I started CivTech Talks while we were in between jobs at the start of 2021. We felt that other recent graduates and college students also needed a resource to hear about collective experience in civic tech and tech for social good. While we initially began to interview other Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellows, we also ended up interviewing Mitchell Weiss, a Harvard Business School professor and former Chief of Staff to the Mayor of Boston, and Hana Schank and Tara Dawson McGuinness, two former Obama Administration Officials.

Prior to the start of season 2, Chizo Nwagwu joined Evan and I to make CivTech Talks an even better project, with more frequent episodes of higher quality. Our first episode will interview the founding members of the Column team as we continue to showcase intriguing stories in the civic tech space.
