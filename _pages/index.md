about-description: I am a software engineer who is unceasingly determined to build technology for social good. I currently work at Column, a startup that develops software for local newspapers and makes public data more accessible to local communities. I previously worked at the Texas Democratic Party and at the US Department of Health and Human Services. <br /><br />In my free time, I host <a href="/posts/civtech-talks">CivTech Talks</a>, a civic tech podcast, with Chizo Nwagwu and Evan De Broux. I am an avid traveler and foodie, and I love to try new restaurants, recipes, and cafes! I also enjoy reading books, playing tennis, and watching Chicago sports.
