<p>My name is Ajay Jain, and I am a freshman at the University of Illinois. I am majoring in Statistics and Computer Science, minoring in Informatics, and certifying in Technology Commercialization. In addition, I am a member of the Innovation LLC.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ajayjjain/UIUC-Laundry"><b style="color:#002058"><font size="4">illiniLaundry</font></b></a>
<p>An app that allows residents of University of Illinois dorms to monitor their laundry load in real-time, as well as notifying them when it is complete. Users of the app can also see how many washers and dryers are available in the dorms on the University of Illinois campus. I am working on developing the iOS application of illiniLaundry.</p>

<b style="color:#002058"><font size="4">LaundryAlert</font></b>
<p>LaundryAlert is a multi-institutional version of IlliniLaundry. Whereas IlliniLaundry was intended to be utilized by students at UIUC alone, LaundryAlert could be used at 30+ institutions such as Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ajayjjain/Monopoly-Simulation"><b style="color:#002058"><font size="4">MonopolySimulation</font></b></a>
<p>This simulation determines how many rolls of a dice does it take in a game of Monopoly to land in jail. It can run more than a million games of Monopoly and output statistics, including mean, median, and mode, the maximum amount of rolls it took to land in jail for the simulations, and outliers.</p>

<p>PiWake is a Raspberry Pi-powered alarm clock that wakes a person up with weather information. Using the weather conditions for that day, PiWake also suggests clothing to wear. PiWake will eventually be made into an app at a hackathon.</p>

<a href="https://innovationsofajay.wordpress.com/2014/09/14/raspberry-pi-weather-bot/"><b style="color:#002058"><font size="4">Raspberry Pi Weather Texter</font></b></a>
<p>Instead of text-to-speech output that PiWake used, the Weather Texter used a Twilio API to text the output.</p>
